--rest design 
There are many cases of unattractive Web APIs that use HTTP GET to trigger something transactional on the server—for instance, to add records to a database. In these cases the GET request URI is not used properly or at least not used RESTfully. If the Web API uses GET to invoke remote procedures, it looks like this: 

GET /adduser?name=Robert HTTP/1.1
